# AI-Crime-Scene-Investigation-Competiton-AI-Week-2024
Unleash the power of artificial intelligence to solve complex forensic challenges! This competition combines cutting-edge AI technologies with real-world investigative scenarios to simulate the challenges of crime-solving. Participants will apply techniques in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, digital forensics, and predictive analytics to tackle a series of engaging challenges designed to test their problem-solving skills and creativity.

# Introduction
The AI Crime Scene Investigation Competition is a multi-challenge event where participants must use AI techniques to analyze evidence and solve a fictional missing person case. Each challenge is crafted to mimic real-world investigative scenarios, such as decoding encrypted messages, analyzing digital footprints, and identifying clues from witness testimonies or images.

The competition not only tests technical skills but also promotes innovative thinking in applying AI to the domain of forensic science.

# Challenges

# Challenge 1: Witness Testimony Analysis with NLP
Analyze witness statements to extract crucial information that could help locate the missing person.

Tasks:
- Extract keywords and keyphrases to identify critical details.
- Perform sentiment and tone analysis to evaluate witness reliability.
- Use entity recognition to uncover important names, places, or dates.

# Challenge 2: AI-Based Clue Identification in Images
- Analyze crime scene photographs or surveillance images to uncover potential leads.

Tasks:
Detect objects or people of interest in images.
Perform facial recognition to match faces to known individuals.
Identify anomalies or tampering in crime scene images.

# Challenge 3: Digital Footprint Pattern Recognition
Uncover patterns in the missing person’s digital activities to reveal potential trails.

Tasks:
Analyze timestamped data for trends or anomalies.
Recognize communication patterns or behavioral changes.
Map social networks to identify connections.

# Challenge 4: AI-Powered Text Message Decoding (XOR Cipher)
Decode encrypted or disguised messages exchanged before the disappearance.

Tasks:
Decrypt messages using the XOR cipher to uncover hidden information.
Identify text patterns and clues within decrypted content.
Analyze the intent behind the messages, such as warnings or requests for help.

# Challenge 5: Predicting the Missing Person’s Next Location
Predict the next possible location of the missing person based on available clues.

Tasks:
Analyze movement patterns and predict likely routes or destinations.
Use behavioral analysis to simulate potential scenarios.
Incorporate geographic constraints to refine predictions.
