# AI Crime Scene Investigation Competiton AI Week 2024
Unleash the power of artificial intelligence to solve complex forensic challenges! This competition combines cutting-edge AI technologies with real-world investigative scenarios to simulate the challenges of crime-solving. Participants will apply techniques in natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, digital forensics, and predictive analytics to tackle a series of engaging challenges designed to test their problem-solving skills and creativity.

# Introduction
The AI Crime Scene Investigation Competition is a multi-challenge event where participants must use AI techniques to analyze evidence and solve a fictional missing person case. Each challenge is crafted to mimic real-world investigative scenarios, such as decoding encrypted messages, analyzing digital footprints, and identifying clues from witness testimonies or images.

The competition not only tests technical skills but also promotes innovative thinking in applying AI to the domain of forensic science.

# Challenges

# Challenge 1: Testimony Analysis üó£Ô∏èüìã
Analyze witness testimonies to extract critical insights using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This challenge focuses on identifying keywords, sentiment, named entities, and detecting potential lies in witness statements.

Tasks:
- Extract keywords and keyphrases to identify critical details.
- Perform sentiment and tone analysis to evaluate witness reliability.
- Use entity recognition to uncover important names, places, or dates.

# Challenge 2: AI-Based Clue Identification in Images
Analyze crime scene photographs or surveillance images to uncover potential leads.

Tasks:
- Detect objects or people of interest in images.
- Perform facial recognition to match faces to known individuals.
- Identify anomalies or tampering in crime scene images.

# Challenge 3: Anomaly Detection in Online Activity üåêüîç
Analyze and classify online search activity to detect anomalies or suspicious behavior using advanced machine learning techniques. This challenge highlights the application of feature engineering, handling imbalanced data, and fine-tuning models for optimal performance.

Tasks:
- Feature engineering and keyword detection in textual data.
- Managing imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
- Hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV.
- Building robust machine learning pipelines for anomaly detection.

# Challenge 4: Decrypting Encrypted Communications üîíüí¨
Decrypt messages exchanged between individuals to uncover hidden information critical to the investigation. Participants will work with XOR-based encryption and learn how to reverse engineer the cipher using keys.

Tasks:
- Implementing XOR-based encryption and decryption.
- Parsing and processing data from CSV files.
- Automating tasks involving encrypted data handling.

# Challenge 5: Predicting the Suspect's Location üåçüèöÔ∏è
Use a trained machine learning model to predict the suspect's location based on various environmental and physiological conditions. Participants will interact with the model by providing binary inputs for each feature and interpreting the results.

Tasks:
Learn how machine learning models are used in decision-making processes.
Understand the importance of feature engineering and input data alignment.
Experience practical implementations of model-based predictions in Python.
