AI Crime Investigation: The Missing Person Mystery

Welcome, Detectives! I am Sherlock AI, your AI assistant, here to help you solve the case of Sarah Adams' disappearance. Together, we will dive into witness statements, analyze digital trials, and examine crime scenes. With your coding skills and analytical insight, we shall uncover hidden clues and bring Sarah back safely.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Introduction 

Sarah Adams had planned an exciting sleepover with some friends, but the night took a dark turn. Following a tense confrontation, Sarah vanished, and now it is your mission to solve the mystery. Throughout this competition, you will analyze evidence either text or image, decode messages, and predict her final location, leveraging AI tools and your own detective skills. This is no ordinary coding competition; you'll need to think like a detective, connect clues from various sources to reveal hidden motives and ultimately find Sarah. Ready to begin?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started 

1. Clone the Repository: Download the competition repository with the necessary files and skeleton code. Ensure you have all the necessary tools to get started with the investigation.
2. Review the Code: Familiarize yourself with the pre-written code provided in each challenge. These segments will guide you, but you will need to complete the functions to progress. 
3. Prepare for AI Interaction: As we progress, I will be here to provide hints, feedback, and guidance. Make sure to keep up with this manual during your challenges to be able to receive the help you need. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 1:

Sarah's associates have provided their testimonies; you are tasked with identifying possible sentiments and detecting which of them could be hiding secrets or telling lies.
To be able to analyze the statements using the Testimonies file, do the following.

Objectives:

- Extract the keywords and phrases from their statements
- ⁠Discover who is lying and who is telling the truth using sentiment analysis
- ⁠Piece together information to find out the relationship between our victim and the suspects

After anaylysing whos lying:

Suspect List: 
1- Evelyn
2- Josh
3- Ethan
4- Kristy

Josh and Evelyn have been constantly lying, and sounding very suspicious.

The first step is done! You now have a list of suspects to focus on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 2: 

There is digital evidence collected for you to review. You are required to identify suspicious actions from the night Sarah went missing. Take a good look at what the images display from characters and objects then note down what you have observed. 
Check the alignment of the previous statements with the pictures examined to confirm possible theories.

Objectives:

- Analyze crime scene images to identify any anomalies or unusual patterns.
- Compare crime scene photos with posts from the sleepover to identify discrepancies or missing items that could be linked to Sarah’s disappearance.
- Approve what Sarah's friends said in their statements by examining the posts
--hint: check who was not supposed to be there-- 
- Examine specific locations at the last place Sarah was seen, to uncover potential evidence that might provide new insights into the mystery of Sarah’s disappearance.
- Remember to comment and note down your clues to be able to gather more information for solving the mystery!


one boy should not be there, which is ethan.
At the first photo, it is Evelyn, Sarah, and Madyline.
There is a sedative drug in the basement, implying that Sarah has been put to sleep before getting kidnapped.


Well done detectives! you're moving closer to the truth behind Sarah's disappearance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 3:

The actions that would lead to Sarah's disappearance are not quite clear. Therefore, we must check her digital record and see if there is something that could help this mystery. We should discover if there are possible abnormal online activities that would open more room for investigation. 
To dig through Sarah's online activity, use your new model to find clues. hint: Re-run the model, model might not be accurate (Bonus points if you fine tune the model) 

Objectives: 

- Analyze Sarah’s phone records and web searches to identify any unusual patterns or changes in her typical online behavior.
- Investigate specific search topics to uncover potential clues. hint: what would you normally search for when browsing the internet search terms to try: 

best book tropes
toxic friendships
symptoms of panic attack
theme park opening times
reasons of stealing data from university sites
report writing steps
creative writing prompts
yoga for beginners
how to make sushi
how to know if someone is lying
how to save money
signs of anxiety
how to bake a cake
book recommendations
scandal of university data breach
therapeutic approaches for friends with anxiety
top 10 books of 2024
music for studying
how to create a resume
how to manage time effectively
basic anatomy lessons
basic self-defense techniques

- Come up with hypothesis from what is understood of the abnormal topics that Sarah seems more concerned about.

she is having a hard time with a close friend and she thinks she is lying to her. she also thinks (possibly evlyn) is having mental issues it may lead to crimes. All these deviates from sarah's typical behavior

Great job! You now understand a few concepts that were causing Sarah some trouble. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 4:

To form more connections with the information you have collected you will go through Sarah's messages log. However, you will have to figure out a way to decrypt some messages that were damaged. 

Objectives: 

- decrypt the messages to reveal their content
- read through the messages and connect information to build up the scenario of what could have happened
- highlight crucial information and facts revealed in conversations
- string your knowledge of specific concepts to certain people included in several conversation logs 

Wow! You have discovered a new lead in Sarah's case. 

After decrypting, we notice that Kristy is revealing a big secret to Sarah, saying that the data breach is from one of her friends and to be careful of who to be around.
Ethan says that "I'll see you there, we can talk about this thing going on between Evelyn and Kristy", but in the testinmony he said he wasnt at the sleepover, and josh says he was the only boy. the picture however, showed 2 boys in the sleepove, with one taking a photo.
Sarah is really suspicious of Evelyn hiding big secrets. Kristy also revealed the secret about Evelyn to Ethan.
Josh says "how did you know about Evelyn's involvement?" which clearly exposes that Evelyn is involved.
Ethan left the sleepover early. Kristy says that Evelyn is the one who did the breach, however, Evelyn wants to meet Sarah and explain herself, justifying what happened.
Madyline also left the sleepover early, before the big reveal. Josh is suspicious of Kristy knowing too much.
Sarah's last message is to Josh, stating that she went and talked to Evelyn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenge 5: 

Someone was just brought in for more investigation, we questioned the person about what we discovered from the previous step and guess what? the person confessed about everything, ending with where they left Sarah, in the woods, possibly in bad shape. 

You must use your critical thinking and coding skills to uncover Sarah's current location. There are a few places the police department have mentioned near the woods, check the conditions and features of Sarah's situation and input the information. Based on the given data, the model will make predictions for a specific location from the ones listed.
Be careful, make your decisions wisely to be able to use the model correctly. 

Locations: A small cabin, An abandoned hotel, a restaurant, a gas station. load the location model to find out where she is. Hurry!

Objectives:

- Evaluate the provided locations near the woods, considering their proximity to where Sarah was last.
- Think about the possible features Sarah could have been in.
- Predict and input the features for the modal to work.
- Make an accurate decision of the conditions related to Sarah's incident for the model to predict the true location.

-- hint: Case concludes that she was missing for a week, if she survived there is a chance she might be injured, I would be confused if I was her, poor girl, on the day of her disappearance it rained heavily and there was mud all over the place, it was a bit chilly too but not that much, but the wind blew strong from the west. Let's just hope she is okay and hasn't died from thirst.

She is in the small cabin due to these weather conditions and her physical conditions according to the location predictor model.

To conclude, Evelyn was involved with the data breach, and Josh knew about it and kept defending her. After a conversation with Evelyn, Sarah went missing. Indicating Evelyn used a sedative drug on Sarah and left her in the woods (the small cabin), this is because Sarah found out about the breach from Kristy.


Bonus points, plot the tree: hint-> Use this 

plt.figure(figsize=(?, ?))
plot_tree(
    clf_tuned,
    feature_names=X_extended_v2.columns,
    class_names=list(destination_map.keys()),
    filled=?
)

plt.savefig("decision_tree_image.png", format='png', dpi=?) 
plt.show()

Hurry before we lose her!



Code:
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))  
plot_tree(
    clf,
    feature_names=features,
    class_names=list(location_map.values()),
    filled=True  
)

plt.savefig("decision_tree_image.png", format='png', dpi=300) 
plt.show()

in predict.location.py 
but we can not run the code, there is a error with the functions
